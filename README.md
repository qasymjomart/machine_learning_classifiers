# machine_learning_classifiers

## Developed in November 2016

This is course project of Programming for Engineering course. Different machine learning classifiers such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Regularized LDA, SEDC, DLDA, LSVM, KSVM were implemented in C++, and their true errors were compared on four different medical datasets. All mathematical expression were proved and are provided on the project report.
